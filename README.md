Translation Transformer from Scratch (PyTorch)
This project implements a translation model from scratch using PyTorch, showcasing the core concepts of transformer architectures.

Features
Custom Implementation: Builds a transformer model without relying on high-level libraries for the core architecture.
Translation Task: Demonstrates the model on a translation dataset.
Educational Focus: Designed for understanding transformer internals
